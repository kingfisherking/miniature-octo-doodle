Fotomatic code academy responsive design project


I'm writing out a little read me because I just wanted to preface this with an explanation

The prject itself wasn't terrible, but the guidelines and spec sheet used were confusing and wrong in some places

spec sheet: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png

definitely did not understand what needed to be changed so I messed with it until it looked right
